There are red, white and green painted markers all the way up to the monastery, and various forks in the path you can take. I would recommend following the Cami de les Aigues (GR 5) trail, it veers slightly to the left and is the easiest option. It takes you 10 minutes longer to get to the top and ascends less quickly, but has a wider and easier path.  The hike takes between an hour and a half to two hours depending on how fast a hiker you are and which paths you choose to take."

He was then taken to a site by the Olympic Stadium, and a few years later he was placed in a small square behind the medieval shipyards of Barcelona. Finally, in 2003, the decision was made to move it to a permanent place at the end of the newly created Rambla del Raval."
